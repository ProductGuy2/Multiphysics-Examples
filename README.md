From smart product design to smarter manufacturing, our linear, non-linear and advanced non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) solutions simulate structures from components to full systems in an open environment by leveraging the latest paradigms of data and workflow management, cloud computing and AI.

Solve static, dynamic, durability and fatigue problems fast and accurately with state-of-the-art solvers in hours instead of days and perform structural optimization to ensure the best performance at the lowest cost.
