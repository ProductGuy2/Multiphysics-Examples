# Hexagon's Multiphysics Suite
[The Multiphysics suite from Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/computer-aided-engineering-software/multiphysics-simulation-software)
 is a scalable portfolio of products that brings the power of cutting-edge, physics-based simulation technologies to solve real-world engineering problems.

Carrying a long tradition of technical expertise and industry knowledge, we bring the most advanced technologies to solve industrially relevant problems with pragmatic solutions such as vertical applications with built-in domain expertise. Customisation and automation provide access to a rich pool of solutions from 1D solvers to front-end geometry handling, CAD, and meshing technologies

## Multiphysics Structures

From smart product design to smarter manufacturing, our linear, non-linear and advanced non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) solutions simulate structures from components to full systems in an open environment by leveraging the latest paradigms of data and workflow management, cloud computing and AI.

Solve static, dynamic, durability and fatigue problems fast and accurately with state-of-the-art solvers in hours instead of days and perform structural optimization to ensure the best performance at the lowest cost.

## Multiphysics Fluids

We all experience physics-related phenomena daily as fluids act in harmony with structures, magnetics and electrics in various complex ways. Hexagon’s computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions enable engineers to understand these phenomena and account for them in product development.

## Multiphysics Acoustics

From headphones and speakers to electric vehicles and aircraft, sound and noise, acoustics are increasingly important to consumer experience. Hexagon’s acoustic simulation tools enable designers and engineers to understand the key parameters of the sounds we hear and design for optimum acoustic performance.
